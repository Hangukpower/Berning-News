# Berning-News
This prospectus is about Berning News which will employ an autonomous agent that will depoliticize headlines from the top news organizers. The point of this system is to objectify headlines that are leaning left or right so that the reading audience can make an informed decision. This software will be open source and is dedicated to Bernie Sanders.


The system will rank an article from a score of 1-100 in politicalness. The higher the score, the more politicized the contents of the article have become. The autonomous agent will employ an algorithm that will change these top headlines coming from the New York Times, LA Times, CNBC, CBS, Twitter, and other major news organizations.

The system will also log only highly viewed or trending articles. Parsing through every single article will become exponentially difficult for the autonomous agent to become efficient so it will only focus on a specific amount of articles per day.

The end application will be something akin to Twitter where a user can scroll through the feed and only get  the most objective headlines. This system will go further and depoliticize entire articles in a later iteration.

The prototype of this system will be employed through Twitter since that is one platform that has live news incoming throughout the day.
